Cardapio is an application that has options for Recipes. You can browse the Categories to find options for Ingredients and Recipe Steps!
Recipes can also be filtered through the app's settings and the user can also add favorite recipes for quick access.

## About the project

This is another application developed through an introductory Flutter course. 
In this module we focused on learning how to use images, scroll structures, menu drawer and tabBar.

In the app you can interact by favoriting your recipes, filtering the options by certain attributes and accessing recipes by category.
